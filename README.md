# MDL.AI Site

## Purpose
This is a open source frontend to put AI inference models into production, it is intended to be used as a learning resource for what I consider the most perfomant and productive way for individuals to create UI's for their machine learning projects, that runs accros iOS, Android and Web by taking advantage of PWA's.

## Details
It is a 100% static website built with SvelteKit which is framework currently in beta, this in turn uses Vite which uses Rollup. This toolkit offers the best possible end user experience, scoring 100% on Google's lighthouse tool, while also being extremely productive for development, as the hot reload updates in milliseconds.

It is being hosted on AWS Amplify for convienience, but can call the API from anywhere.

## Formatting
I use auto formatting on all of my code for higher productivity, yapf for Python, clangd for C++ and prettier for html/js/css. While I use a line width of 100 for Python and C++, for html I prefer 500 to keep each element on a single line.
